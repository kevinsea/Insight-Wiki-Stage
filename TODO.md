# TODO #

A list of things that we want to add to Insight.Database:

- Automatic generation of Repositories to bind to stored procedures
- Allow Insight to do blocking calls in Async mode when the database provider doesn't support it. This allows a single code base to be written as async even though it may use different providers.
